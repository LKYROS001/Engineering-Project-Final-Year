Reposity Built to run holographic fan display prototype. <br />
Made possible thanks to CoorFuns cAPA102 LED library "https://github.com/CoorFun/cAPA102" <br />
To use the program run the make file and both "convert.py" programs, inserting whichever pictures or video frames you wish to use into the appropriate folders. <br />
used the command "./final" to display static images, and "./video" to display video
